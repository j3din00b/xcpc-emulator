INFORMATIONS:
-------------

This software is based on the Marat Fayzullin's Z80 emulator
(http://www.komkon.org/fms/).
But a complete rewrite of the Z80 emulator is in progress.
At this time, the emulator only supports SNAPSHOTS (*.sna) for loading games.

COMPILATION:
------------

  Generic UNIX .. Makefile
  DEC OSF 4.0 ... Makefile.OSF
  Solaris 5-8 ... Makefile.Solaris
  Linux ......... Makefile.Linux

  1) Edit your Makefile:
  ----------------------

  Please set the endian of your system in the CFLAGS variable:
  If your system is big endian (x86, alpha, ...), add -DLSB_FIRST
  If your system is low endian (68k, sparc, ...), add -DMSB_FIRST
  If you don't kown how your system is, do the following:

  cc src/endian.c -o endian
  ./endian
  it will return the system type: LSB_FIRST or MSB_FIRST.

  2) Compile the emulator:
  ------------------------

  Generic UNIX .. make clean all
  DEC OSF 4.0 ... make -f Makefile.OSF clean all
  Solaris 5-8 ... make -f Makefile.Solaris clean all
  Linux ......... make -f Makefile.Linux clean all

-cpc664 ... cpc664 hardware and -4MHz -50Hz -amstrad -CTM644.
-cpc6128 .. cpc6128 hardware and -4MHz -50Hz -amstrad -CTM644.

If no options are given, the software emulates a CPC 6128 @ 4MHz, with a CTM644
monitor @ 50Hz, made by Amstrad.

CHANGELOG
---------

-----------
- Improved CRTC 6845 and gate-array emulation; supports Sorcery like games.
- GFX routines rewritten.
- Partial support of multi-modes.

15/06/2001:
-----------
- Improved CRTC 6845 emulation; supports Space Racer like modes.

14/06/2001:
-----------
- Improved GUI and event manager.
- Improved Z80 encapsulation.

13/06/2001:
-----------
- Improved gate_array and crtc support.
- Removed FAST_GFX conditionnal compilation; dynamic configuration.

12/06/2001:
-----------
- Display bugs corrected; complete rewrite of display routines.
- GUI module added.
- Some modifications in source code.

01/06/2001:
-----------
- Lots of improvements in GUI (GFX mode added).
