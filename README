GENERAL
-------

This software is based on the Marat Fayzullin's Z80 emulator
(http://www.komkon.org/fms/).
But a complete rewrite of the Z80 emulator is in progress.
At this time, the emulator only supports SNAPSHOTS (*.sna) for loading games.

COMPILATION

See 'INSTALL'

NOTES
-----

  -cpc464 ... cpc464 hardware and -4MHz -50Hz -amstrad -CTM644.
  -cpc664 ... cpc664 hardware and -4MHz -50Hz -amstrad -CTM644.
  -cpc6128 .. cpc6128 hardware and -4MHz -50Hz -amstrad -CTM644.

If no options are given, the software emulates a CPC 6128 @ 4MHz, with a CTM644
monitor @ 50Hz, made by Amstrad.
